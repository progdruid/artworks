Hi!
This is a folder of my artwork: Rainbow Mandelbrots.

This artwork is about fractals, exactly the mandelbrot family.

I've written it in GLSL with ShaderToy, so if you want to run it you can just follow the links: [Mandelbrot](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7ddcW8), [Tribrot](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7ddyD8), [Multibrot](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ss3yDN), and [FractalFly](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/sddcDN).
